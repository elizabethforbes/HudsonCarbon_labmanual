This site is the home of the Hudson Carbon lab manual and collaboration field guide. We use this (living, editable, evolving) document to keep track of our lab's collectively-generated code of conduct; list of important resources; expectations; and tips and tricks for successful collaboration (an under-appreciated and surprisingly difficult skill).

The document is collaborative and mainly edited by Hudson Carbon research director Elizabeth Forbes. Her contact information is:
